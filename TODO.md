# Todo List

- [ ] Our current system for handling user files doesn't work. Files do not get saved throughout multiple sessions. Need to fix this (somehow)
- [ ] Find more data to store
- [ ] Better boost.info command
- [ ] Move all data to be saved in a single dictionary
- [ ] BoostOS quiz
- [ ] Encapsulate user data (mainly should be used to automatically save values every time they change)
- [ ] Do some housekeeping (clean up and seperate code)
- [ ] Create a theming system with more than just accent colours
- [ ] Create a way to pin info to your main menu
- [X] Supress ^C-ing out of the system
- [ ] Create a downloading tool to download files from the internet
- [ ] Use threading to make things faster
- [ ] Make a background in `edit` that renders unused space
- [ ] Make a function that centers text using `os.get_terminal_size()`
