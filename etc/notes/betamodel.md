# Boost OS Beta Model

Here at the Boost OS Team, we like to be innovative and expand on our technologies.
That is why Boost OS follows an open beta model.
This means that beta features will be open to the public to test and try out.

Here's how beta feature releasing will work:

1. We will create a feature that will be put into beta form first.
2. Users can test out the beta feature in their own personal experiences.
3. Users can report any bugs they find with the feature using our report tool.
4. We will iterate on the feature based on reports by the users.
5. Users can keep testing the tool, giving us feedback, and we can keep iterating on the tool.
6. When we feel ready to release the tool out of beta, it will get released in the next version update with other smaller features.

Do note that beta addition, updates, and deletions do not affect the version number.
We keep a flowing beta release model, and changes to the beta set of tools will not count as updates to the system.
Only when the beta feature is actually released into the main system and gets added as a proper command will we count it as an update.
