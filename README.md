# BoostOS
âœ¨ Current Version: 1.2.4

Boost OS is a light-weight operating system which is simple,
has saving (and autosave), some applications, and lots of commands.

While it lacks features, it has fun activities to keep you entertained.
It has 3 games/apps and 19 productive commands.

Whilst some of these commands are locked away for Admins only, you can apply!
We handle applications easily, so don't sweat.

Please make sure your emails have no profanity or offensive content as we will ignore it.
